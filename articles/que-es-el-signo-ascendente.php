<p>In each of our <strong>natal charts</strong>, the <strong>Ascendant sign</strong> holds paramount importance. The Ascendant represents a crucial aspect of <strong>personal destiny</strong>, indicating the optimal way for us to live and express ourselves in order to <strong>feel free and whole</strong>.</p>

<p>The Ascendant signifies how we connect with the <strong>external world or environment</strong> when our energy flows spontaneously. Hence, it reveals a general approach to life. The Ascendant is how I present myself, the first impression I give to others.</p>

<p>A disciple of the <i>Rudhyar</i> school of <strong>humanistic astrology</strong>, <i>Alexander Ruperti</i>, defines the Ascendant as follows: <i>"The Sign and degree found on the Ascendant at birth indicates the <strong>fundamental character</strong> as well as the <strong>purpose of essential being</strong>, the reason for incarnation, from the perspective of the <strong>needs of the Universe</strong> of which one is a particular expression. This is what has been called destiny: what one is going to <strong>be</strong> and also what one <strong>is</strong>."</i></p>

<p>The Ascendant is the <strong>lens</strong> through which we perceive existence, the <strong>vision</strong> we bring to life, our way of <strong>categorizing the world</strong>. And since we see the world in that way, we invariably act and behave according to our vision.</p>

<p>That's why, when <strong>learning astrology</strong> and, of course, when getting my natal chart done, I must keep in mind the <strong>value and significance</strong> of the Ascendant.</p>
