<p>If you've ever created your <strong>natal chart</strong>, read about astrology, or taken an astrology course, you'll recall terms like "squares," "oppositions," "conjunctions," etc. These are the <em>angular aspects</em> in astrology, indicating in a natal chart where the <em>difficulties</em> lie and where the possibilities for expansion and growth exist. If we consider a natal chart akin to a musical piece, various themes will stand out. These themes can be uncovered through methods of <strong>astrological interpretation</strong>, with darker, brighter, and also grayish areas.</p>
<p>As an astrologer, my aim is to pinpoint where the <em><strong>tensions</strong></em> and <em><strong>harmonies</strong></em> lie within an individual through their natal chart during an astrological consultation. For example, some people experience tension or difficulty in the realm of emotional life, love, and relationships. Throughout their lives, they must learn to master that obstructive energy. For others, difficulties arise in areas like economics, work, family, etc. <em>Each person is different and unique.</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, we all have harmonic aspects in our natal chart, which represent the natural and spontaneous abilities and aptitudes we each have in different areas. We say that tense aspects generate inner tension. But the key will always be <em>how the individual channels that energy and tries to alleviate that pressure.</em> A square, for instance, may manifest as a physical or psychological problem or as a reservoir of energy that can be uncovered for creative purposes. We should not underestimate the power of the <strong>Mind</strong> and <strong>Will</strong>; our thoughts, ideals, and desires can subtly alter the lines of energy within our total <em>energy field.</em></p>
