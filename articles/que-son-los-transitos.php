<p>An astrologer can study a person's <strong>natal chart</strong>, their qualities, their potential achievements in different areas, or their negative tendencies. It's clear that the Natal Chart represents our <strong>psychic structure</strong>, and it doesn't change. But why do we have the ability to <strong>change</strong> throughout our lives? Why do we experience marked periods of <strong>growth</strong> and others of <strong>frustrations and difficulties</strong>? What determines these <strong>cycles</strong> in our lives?</p>
 
<p>Astrology, through serious study, can assist a person over time with various forecasting and prediction methods such as <strong>progressions, directions, solar revolutions</strong> (annual chart) and <strong>lunar revolutions</strong> (monthly chart).</p>

<p>The simplest system is that of the <strong>Transits</strong> of planets over the natal chart itself. The natal chart is actually a <strong>still photo of the sky</strong> at the exact moment and place of birth. The planets continue their journey; this is called <i>"transit"</i>. A Transit is the <strong>movement</strong> of a planet through the zodiac day by day, week by week, year by year. Each planet, in its course, passes through different signs, forming <strong>aspects</strong> with natal planets or other significant points in the natal chart, or simply transiting through an empty <strong>house</strong> or sector of our chart.</p>

<p>The duration of their passage through each house depends on the planet in question, as each has its <strong>pace and speed</strong>, taking a certain amount of time. For example, some planets take longer than others in their journey; <strong>Pluto</strong> may spend <strong>20 years</strong> in the same sign. The <strong>Moon</strong>, on the other hand, will only be in each zodiac sign for about <strong>2 days and a few hours</strong>. If, for example, I am going to have a transit of <strong>Pluto</strong> or <strong>Neptune</strong> for 3 years, it would be good to know, anticipate, prepare, and take advantage of the opportunity to make necessary changes. This <strong>attitude</strong> will be much more <strong>positive</strong> than resisting, denying, getting anxious, or frustrated in the face of projects that do not bear fruit simply because it is not the right time to put my energies into that. But I can certainly channel my energies into many other things where I can <strong>develop and grow</strong> in a different way.</p>

<p>This is where the vital importance of knowing the transits of planets over my natal chart lies. The most important transits are those of the slower planets, as they have more lasting effects: <strong>Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter</strong>. If you want to know your transits for this year, that is, your <strong>cycles of change and growth</strong>, request your natal chart and your Personal Interview.</p>
