  <p>To understand the relationship between <strong>Astrology and numbers</strong>, there are <strong>two factors</strong> we must consider: <strong>first</strong>, the <strong>natural need</strong> in humans to <strong>seek knowledge</strong>, both to predict what will happen to them and to understand their deeper nature, their true essence, and the meaning of their existence.</p>
  <p><strong>Second</strong>, there are <strong>very ancient knowledge</strong> that satisfies these concerns and more. For example, in ancient Greece, the so-called <strong>"Greater Mysteries"</strong> were taught, where rich and complex sciences like <strong>Astrology</strong> were reserved for a smaller number of people, and then the <strong>"Lesser Mysteries"</strong>, such as <strong>Numerology</strong>, where the inner knowledge of the human being was transmitted in a more popular form. The interesting thing is that everyone had access to <strong>psychological and spiritual guidance</strong>, in one way or another.</p>
  <p>Now, beyond the daily and common use of numbers, we have to see them here as <strong>Archetypes</strong> that order, are universal elements and as such, have power linked to <strong>external</strong> cosmic flows, forces, planets, colors, sounds, metals, chemical elements, geometric figures, vibrational frequencies, etc. And in our <strong>internal</strong> being, associated with certain vital centers, organic processes, emotional states, etc.</p>
  <p>Just as numbers serve as a link between what comes from outside and what is inside; Astrology studies the principles and laws that govern these two sides of the same coin, present in everything that exists. What happens in the sky is synchronized with what we have to live; be it learning on a personal, social, or global level.</p>
  <p><strong>Let's briefly review the basic astrological language:</strong> The <strong>12 Houses</strong> represent the <strong>fields of experience</strong> where concrete energies are expressed more easily, and where the individual faces them most directly (e.g., House 4, home, family). The <strong>signs</strong> are the <strong>modes of energy</strong>, for example, Libra's diplomacy is not the same as Aries' impulsiveness and vigor. And finally, the <strong>planets</strong> are responsible for <strong>dynamizing the energy, regulating the flow</strong>. In a person's natal chart, they speak of their psychological functions; for example, Mercury represents intelligence, and the Moon represents emotions. For the ancients, these were deities: Venus, the goddess of love, or Saturn, the God of Time.</p>
  <p><strong>With this clarified, let's go through the nine numbers and their analogies:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>ONE:</strong> The beginning, the monad, unity. <strong>Associated with the Sun</strong>. In humans, it is associated with the cardiac plexus, the heart, ideas of firmness, originality, will, initiative. The masculine.</p>
  <p><strong>TWO:</strong> Duality, sensitivity. <strong>Associated with the Moon</strong> and the lymphatic system, the stomach, the sense of taste, principles of association, adaptation, passivity, and domesticity. The feminine.</p>
  <p><strong>THREE:</strong> The triad, in creation, the principle of transmutation, manifestation, renewal. <strong>The planet is Jupiter</strong>. Linked to the liver, an organ responsible for over 200 functions in our body. Muscle tension in the body. Ideas of expansion, good spirits.</p>
  <p><strong>FOUR:</strong> Principle of concretion, reality, and permanence. Refers in the body to nervous fluid, the action of hormones. <strong>The related planet is Uranus</strong>, which in Astrology breaks structures to innovate. Intuitive intelligence.</p>
  <p><strong>FIVE:</strong> Principle of androgyny, of what is itself both masculine and feminine. <strong>Planet: Mercury</strong>. In humans, it is associated with the nervous system, the action of bile, ingenious ideas, persuasion, research, selection, and understanding.</p>
  <p><strong>SIX:</strong> Principle of rest and movement. <strong>Linked to Venus</strong> and the sacral plexus, the glandular system. It is the affective, what relates us, reciprocity, fertility.</p>
  <p><strong>SEVEN:</strong> Principle of time and space, of what summarizes in itself the material but is the cause that operates beyond that. <strong>Its planet is Neptune</strong>. Related to spirituality, what is beyond, the longing for transcendent life.</p>
  <p><strong>EIGHT:</strong> In creation, the principle of evolution and involution, of light and shadow. <strong>Its planet is Saturn</strong>. It has to do with bones, the spine. Ideas that require calculation, cooperation, moderation, and fair distribution.</p>
  <p><strong>NINE:</strong> In creation, a relationship of communion between the thinker, thought, and the thought. <strong>The planet is Mars</strong>. It is associated with the crown plexus, the head. Governs blood, the process of combustion. Related to courage, initiative, and spontaneity.</p>
