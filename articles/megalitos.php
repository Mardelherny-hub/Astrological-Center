  <p><strong>The theory, which lacked a solid scientific basis until now, has been supported by new research from Australian experts.</strong><br>
    <br>
  In a recent study, scientists from the <strong>Australian University of Adelaide</strong> have concluded that the stone circles of two <strong>5,000-year-old megaliths</strong> in the United Kingdom are aligned with the <strong>movements of celestial bodies</strong>. Specifically, these are the <strong>Callanish Stones</strong> on the <strong>Isle of Lewis</strong> and the <strong>Stenness megalith</strong> in the <strong>Orkney archipelago</strong>. Both prehistoric monuments are located in <strong>Scotland</strong>.</p>
  <p>In an article titled <a style="color: coral" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X16301808" target="_blank">'Origins of Megalithic Astronomy in England'</a>, the specialists note that until now, there was no scientific evidence that megalithic circles were constructed based on the universe's ideas held by people of that time, although there were theories that suggested it. Now, it has been demonstrated thanks to new technologies.</p>
  <p>The experts from the Australian university <strong>analyzed the geometric proportions of Neolithic circles</strong> using <strong>3D reconstructor software and 3D-GIS reconstructor</strong>. The results demonstrate that <strong>the two monuments</strong> are not only <strong>aligned with planetary orbits</strong> but are also <strong>closely linked to the landscape</strong>.</p>
  <p>Scientists plan to continue their research by analyzing the well-known Stonehenge, a megalithic monument located in southern England that is 500 years more recent than the Callanish Stones and the Stenness.</p>
