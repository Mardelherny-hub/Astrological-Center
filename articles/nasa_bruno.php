  <p><strong>They are within what astronomers consider the habitable zone, the region around a star where luminosity and radiation flow would allow the presence of life.</strong><br>
    <br>
    NASA announced this Wednesday a <strong>new discovery</strong> regarding exoplanets, planets that orbit a star different from the Sun and, therefore, do not belong to the Solar System.<br>
    The NASA finding sets a record for the number of planets and the number of potential Earth-like candidates around a single star.</p>
  <p>The possibility of finding other planets like Earth is something that the great astronomer <strong>Giordano Bruno</strong> asserted more than 4 centuries ago. In 1584, Giordano Bruno wrote <strong>"On the Infinite Universe and Worlds."</strong> In this work, he spoke of the <strong>Universe as an infinite space</strong> filled with <strong>worlds like ours</strong>. These statements earned him his condemnation to the stake.</p>
  <p>Giordano Bruno said: "There are <strong>countless suns; countless Earths</strong> revolve around those suns in a similar way to how planets revolve around our Sun."<br>
    What Giordano Bruno said over 400 years ago is now confirmed by NASA through modern Astronomy.</p>
  <p>Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, commented on the new discovery by stating that it "gives us a hint that the issue is not whether we will find a second Earth, but when."</p>
