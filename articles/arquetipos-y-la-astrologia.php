<p>Currently, the use of the word <em><strong>Myth</strong></em> has been distorted by popular knowledge (<em>doxa</em>). It is vulgarly said that a "Myth" is something false, invented. In reality, Myth has another meaning; it is a symbolic, allegorical narrative of <em>processes</em>. For more information on the true meaning of Myths, we recommend reading <em>Joseph Campbell</em>, an expert in mythology from a <em>Jungian perspective</em>.</p>
