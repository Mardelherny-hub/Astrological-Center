<p>Allows clarifying points of affinity and conflict in Personal, Work, and other relationships.</p>
<p>The study of relationships between two individuals should begin with a comprehensive analysis of their own natal charts. This involves understanding the psychological type or predominant tendency in each of the two members of a relationship. While this type of report is widely used for couples, the study can also be done for business partnerships, parents and children, friendships, etc. This is crucial because gaining a deeper understanding of the other person will help in comprehending and supporting them better. Basically, the work is divided into 2 parts:</p>

<p>1. Study of the tendencies of each individual when it comes to relationships, focusing on the primary needs, desires, and orientations of each. What is being sought in the relationship? What ideal predominates (following Jung's idea of Anima â€“ Animus, i.e., the ideal of a man for a woman and the ideal of a woman for a man)?</p>

<p>2. How will the energy fields of the two individuals interact? How will these two people "nourish" each other? This particularly involves analyzing the balance of the elements water, fire, earth, and air in each of the two charts (this shows the energy, the overall tone that combines in the relationship). What type of impression prevails? A good balance most of the time? Too much emphasis on stimulation and excitement? Too much focus on security? Do both possess what the other lacks, and if so, are the partners too different, or can they handle each other's differences and even appreciate them?</p>

<p>This analysis will give us an idea of the complementarity that exists between the two individuals. For example, two fire individuals may be especially creative and productive with a lot of inventive capacity and intensity, but without the balance of the other elements, their creations may turn out impractical or get lost, requiring the earth element to balance the partnership.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean they are inevitably destined to repeat these patterns, but rather, by understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the relationship, there's greater freedom to identify, modify, and work on them. All relationships contain greater or lesser potential for growth, reflecting areas of ourselves that require development and acting as catalysts for areas that others need to address specifically. <br>
It's important to emphasize that the function of synastry is not to pass rigid judgments regarding the advisability of maintaining a relationship but to highlight areas of understanding and challenging aspects, to enhance the former and work constructively on the latter, serving as a guide for more conscious decision-making.</p>

<p>The Archetypes of ANIMA - ANIMUS: according to Jung</p>

<p>Carl Jung, the famous psychologist, spoke of the concept of ANIMA AND ANIMUS: the ideal image or archetype that a woman has of men and everything masculine, and the one that a man has about women. The ideal image is partly collective and historical, meaning it depends on the era. For example, during the Renaissance, the image of women that inspired men, muses, for example, was very different from the current one. The same goes for the view of the masculine that women had. However, there are also personal, unique trends beyond the time. Sometimes, the values of the time confuse individuals who end up seeking their counterpart according to established norms, trends, and not according to their inner desires. These desires often remain unconscious, unknown to ourselves; astrology allows us to become aware of our deep emotional needs, clarifying the confusion.</p>

<p>These symbols are extremely important when trying to understand what really happens in human interaction.</p>

<p>Karmic Relationships:</p>

<p>All relationships provide opportunities for personal growth. Relationships bring us obstacles and rewards, make us descend to the depths and ascend to the summit, allow us personal participative experience that shows what we really do with our philosophy of life when we have to put into practice what we think. When karma is involved, we tend to experience a lack of control over circumstances and events, as well as a lack of control over how to react to such events. Karmically, those qualities have to evolve if the individual wants to grow and be more in touch with their current life. The karmic relationship takes on more of the individual's tone, removing the veil of illusions from the other. Through this process, a new awareness is reached, and as the burden of karmic weight eases, a sense of lightness and freedom can be experienced. It is interesting to note that the karmic model is usually understood clearly only after learning a lesson. An individual may strive to maintain a difficult relationship for months or years without realizing the purpose of their effort. The karmic burden only dissolves after the difficulty has come to light and has been resolved. The reward for this challenging task is understanding, which comes when we become aware of the interconnected link between the residues of past life and the present.</p>

<p>If we can learn to nourish each other instead of clinging to ourselves, even the most challenging aspects symbolized in a horoscope become part of the constant flow of the stream of life. We can harness karma instead of sinking into it. The burdens, responsibilities, and obstacles we face can ultimately become the support capable of strengthening a character in constant growth.</p>
