<p>In each of our natal charts, the ASCENDANT sign is of utmost importance. The ASCENDANT represents a crucial aspect of personal DESTINY, in the sense that it guides us on the best way to live and express ourselves to feel free and whole.</p>

<p>In astrology courses and the study of astrology, we dedicate an entire chapter of the curriculum to investigating the ASCENDANT and its symbolic connotations.</p>

<p>The ASCENDANT represents how we connect with the EXTERNAL world or environment when our energy flows spontaneously. Therefore, it reveals a general approach to life.</p>

<p>That's why I propose to astrology students to explore and investigate their ascendant sign. This will allow them to delve deeper into the process of self-discovery.</p>

<p>The ascendant is how I present myself, the first image, or the first impression I give to others.</p>

<p>A disciple of the Rudhyar school of humanistic astrology, Alexander Ruperti, defines the ascendant as follows: "The Sign and degree found on the Ascendant at birth indicate the fundamental character, as well as the purpose of the essential being, the reason for incarnation, from the perspective of the needs of the Universe of which one is a particular expression. This is what has been called destiny: what one is going to be and also what one is."</p>

<p>The Ascendant is the lens through which we perceive existence, the vision we bring to life, our way of categorizing the world. And since we see the world in that way, we invariably act and behave according to our vision.</p>

<p>That's why, when learning astrology, and of course, when creating my natal chart, I must keep in mind the value and meaning of the ascendant.</p>
