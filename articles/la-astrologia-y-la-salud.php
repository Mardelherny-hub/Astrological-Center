<p>There is a more than interesting relationship between medicine and astrology. In fact, we are beings of energy, a psyche or soul that embodies in a physical body, forming an inseparable whole until the moment of death. The zodiac signs and planets influence us both psychologically (marking influences on mood, vocational tendencies, emotions, etc.) and physically. Since the natal chart and the study of astrology allow us to see our PHYSICAL PREDISPOSITIONS regarding health and disease. Each of the 12 zodiac signs is associated with a part of the body; let's look at some of the analogies between astrology and the physical body:</p>

<p>Aries: The Head</p>

<p>Taurus: Throat, Thyroid Gland, neck, and cervical spine</p>

<p>Gemini: Lungs, respiratory function, and extremities</p>

<p>Cancer: Stomach, digestive function</p>

<p>Leo: Heart, circulatory system, and back</p>

<p>Virgo: Intestines, colon</p>

<p>Libra: Kidneys, nephritic system</p>

<p>Scorpio: Genitourinary organs and large intestine</p>

<p>Sagittarius: Thighs, lumbar region, sciatic nerve, liver, and liver function</p>

<p>Capricorn: Knees and joints in general, teeth, skin</p>

<p>Aquarius: Ankles, blood circulation, nervous system</p>

<p>Pisces: Feet, mucous membranes, and lymphatic system</p>
