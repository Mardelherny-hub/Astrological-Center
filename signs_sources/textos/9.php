<p>As a true fire sign, Sagittarius encourages movement and the search for the expansion of one's own identity. The boldness of fire will venture into physical or mental journeys, seeking to move on the geographical and thought planes. Travel puts us in contact with the different, takes us out of our everyday context to transport us to unknown scenarios, distancing us from our accustomed family symbols. Confronting the world implies having to deal with "strangers," not necessarily in a close or intimate relationship. In fact, Sagittarius is a sign that needs freedom; nothing is worse for it than feeling restricted or constrained in its need for movement. It can be said that Sagittarius is a sign that fights against restrictions, at least those imposed in its path.</p>
<p>Sagittarius is an optimist and enthusiast by definition. Its positive attitude, coupled with its ambition, urges it to desire great things. In fact, Sagittarius will not easily settle for what is within reach, for the known, the small, the everyday. It can even get terribly bored if it lacks other types of stimuli.</p>
<p>Being an enthusiast by definition, it is easy and spontaneous for Sagittarius to convey its ideas and communicate with others, making it an excellent educator, communicator, transmitter of ideas.</p>
<p>Combining the intellectual with the physical is what the mythological symbol of the centaur proposes. We can say that in every Sagittarius, two parts coexist: the physical, instinctive part symbolized by the horse; and, on the other hand, the rational, mental, idealistic part symbolized by the human part. Hence, Sagittarius' fondness for movement, sports, and the need to be part of a larger whole. That is, being part of a higher Ideal, whether intellectual, political, religious, professional, etc.</p>
<p>Generosity characterizes this sign, which often does not modulate its energies, becoming at times somewhat exaggerated, disorderly, or even overwhelmed in its actions. Learning to manage its energies and resources, managing communication, are things that life will have to teach it.</p>
<p>In relationships, Sagittarius is often expressive of its feelings, although always respecting individual space and freedom. It is not usually a possessive or dependent sign. In fact, they may sometimes tend to get bored quickly in very static relationships, leading them to seek to introduce changes that inject a dose of energy and revive their relationships.</p>
<p>Sagittarius is also associated with beliefs and faith. Whatever its belief, Sagittarius bears witness to the healing power of faith and hope. Without Sagittarian faith, life can seem like a wasteland, meaningless, too mundane, and oppressive. The less philosophical Sagittarians, those who may doubt the existence of a divine guide, will always place their belief or ideal in something (a political, family, sports, intellectual ideal, etc.), although this may change throughout life.</p>
<p>Sagittarius must learn to expand without overestimating itself. The image would be that of fire expanding but with control and guidance so that it does not become uncontrolled expansion or a "fire." In psychological terms, the danger would be pride and the exaltation of the Self.</p>
<p>Returning to the more positive side, Sagittarius usually seeks personalities to play the role of a guide throughout their lives. These figures can be various people, from a teacher or professor to a spiritual idol, an intellectual ideology, or any other kind. As they grow and mature, they may become the ones who guide and help others, taking on the role of a leader.</p>
<p>Jupiter is the planet associated with Sagittarius, the largest planet in the solar system, precisely in a sign that likes to expand. Jupiter is related to the search for growth, optimism, and what we usually call "luck." In Greek mythology, Jupiter-Zeus was the supreme god of Olympus who imparted justice and guided the rest of the beings.</p>
