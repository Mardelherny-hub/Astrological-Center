<p>Gemini, being an Air sign, brings a breath of flexibility and adaptability. It's like the wind, with a playful spirit, with air currents that change speed and direction at will, going from a gentle breeze to a sudden gust. Gemini needs more than anyone communication and almost constant interaction with others. They are usually curious, with a very active mind (which often leads them to become scattered). Gemini likes the contrasts and contradictions of life, as they provide different ways of seeing things. They need to express themselves, and if there's something that bothers them, it's censorship. They connect ideas with ideas, people with people, which makes them have great mental activity, always associating and connecting. They have the ability to relate to very diverse and different people, which does not bother Gemini at all. Travel and studies provide evidence of human diversity to Gemini.</p>
<p>All this makes them a very active sign, but it doesn't guarantee finishing everything they start since they tend to get bored or lose interest quickly to move on to something new. This would be the case of someone who starts three books at the same time but doesn't finish any of them, showing a certain inconsistency and superficiality. This can sometimes apply to relationships, where they will seek constant stimulation and try to avoid anything too routine and, above all, anything that restricts their freedom. They will value communication within the couple, as well as in the rest of their relationships.</p>
<p>Their planet Mercury, linked to the mental aspect, studies, and exchanges, makes them a more mental than emotional sign, trying to understand their emotions, passing them through the filter of reason.</p>
