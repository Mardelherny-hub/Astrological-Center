<p>As the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries represents the archetype of the Pioneer, the initiator, the one who blazes trails. This is why Aries demands movement above all else; nothing is worse for them than having to stay still for a long time. Aries was born to give expression to their need for self-expression, and to achieve this, they show great determination and are often guided by strong impulses. In relationships, they will try to preserve their independence. I think all of this makes Aries a sign that feels it has permission to make mistakes, which is why they venture (sometimes they will be wrong and other times not, but that's another matter...). Starting the engine is something that doesn't cost Aries much, and this will make them great motivators, inspiring or motivating others with their actions and ideas. Managing so much energy is not always easy to channel, often leading to emotional outbursts, especially when obstacles stand in their way. However, they usually don't hold any grudges and have the ability to turn the page quickly.</p>

<p>Aries' self-interest is strong, in addition to their initiative and entrepreneurship; they often ignore, minimize, or reject the needs of others. Life teaches them that they cannot always live or act only for themselves, helping them better balance their energies between SELF and OTHERS.</p>

<p>The planet associated with Aries is Mars, known in mythology as the brave fighter with independent decision-making, a planet of action and drive.</p>
