<p>Cancer is characterized by its sensitivity, being the first Water sign of the Zodiac, putting us in touch with our soul, our inner needs, our emotions. It points to a need to let its emotions flow more openly, and also, of course, harbors its spiritual side. It is due to the force of its emotions that it finds it difficult to hide them from others; its joy or displeasure is often more than evident. Depending on its mood, it will see life in that color, black or white, black or white, which makes it easily subjective. Cancer is always alert to the manifest or unmanifest feelings of others; in a way, the needs of others often activate its ability to nurture, to protect what is vulnerable and needs shelter. That's why the notion of clan, homeland, family group, congregation appears in Cancer. In the end, they constitute its search for relationships that stand the test of time and the ups and downs of life. Domestic tranquility, home, family, parents or children are matters of vital importance to Cancer. To the point of being able to realize what the other needs to feel better.</p>
<p>Cancer usually feels a distrust of the new, changes, as it is sometimes rooted in the known (or the past). When Cancer has been hurt, it tends to build protective walls around its heart, trying to navigate only through relationships that seem secure. However, its true nature is warmth.</p>
<p>The planet associated with Cancer is the Moon, receptive by nature (it has no light of its own but emits solar light). Symbolically, the moon also represents the archetype of the Mother and the ancestors, roles that often play important roles in its life. The Moon, moreover, is always changing, from the new moon to the full moon. The moon is the cause of the permanent emotional and mood changes to which Cancer is subjected, ups and downs that it must master over time and experience to avoid emotional wear and tear.</p>
