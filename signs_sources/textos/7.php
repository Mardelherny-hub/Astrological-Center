<p>The Scales is the only inanimate object in the entire zodiac, introducing the impersonal concept of Justice, as well as its impartial character. Libra wants to be fair in its decisions and actions, thus weighing with the scales. For Libra, the Scale is a symbol of the eternal search for balance. It will seek balance, find it at times, and at other times, learn to move most elegantly within unbalancing situations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the two pans of the Scale can be related to the "I" and the "You." That is, Libra seeks balance or harmony between the self and the other, i.e., in human relationships. In fact, Libra belongs to the Air element (along with Gemini and Aquarius), which is the invisible substance that connects us all (we all breathe the same air). That's why communication, the exchange with others, and listening to others' opinions will be vital for Libra. They love reaching agreements, always seeking the path that allows them to avoid conflict and tension, hence their reputation as diplomats, mediators, advisors, and their pursuit of "Social Justice"... Life will teach them that it's not always possible to avoid a discussion or conflict; sometimes, we must assert our position firmly and learn to listen to the non-acceptance or dissent of others (this won't be easy, but with inner work, they can achieve it).</p>
<p>From another perspective, Libra can also be "lighter" (as a good Air sign). As a half-joke, by way of example, I always say that if a social gathering becomes boring or too silent, it's good to have a Libra's phone number on hand to join the meeting and revive communication. Libra will always know how to come up with topics of conversation, initiate dialogue, and make the gathering with others more pleasant and enjoyable.</p>
<p>The need to give and receive, to exchange, is one of the characteristics that make Libra a sign for which life regains greater meaning when in a relationship. Libra wants to fully share life and affection, wishing to include someone else in their life. Therefore, as a partner, they will need someone willing to relinquish some of their independence for the sake of the relationship. They can be great companions and will be attentive to their primary relationships. They are often seductive and charismatic.</p>
<p>The pursuit of harmony leads them to an attraction to the Beautiful, the Aesthetic, the refined. In fact, this characteristic is also given by their associated planet, Venus, the goddess of love, aesthetics, and the arts.</p>
<p>Libra must learn to overcome the tendency to indecision or doubt (the search for balance, in this case, becomes duality and paralysis), allowing them to express their views when necessary, directly and honestly, even if frankness implies some momentary disharmony. They must also learn not to be solely guided by appearances, which, as we know, can be deceiving.</p>
<p>Finally, gathering and considering the opinions of others, and the interest in others, are some of their greatest strengths, something that all signs can learn from the sign of the Scale.</p>
