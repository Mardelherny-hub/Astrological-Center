<p>Among the zodiac signs, Capricorn is a sign that usually does not take things lightly, especially those obligations related to work, profession, or personal goals. Being an earth sign (like Taurus and Virgo), Capricorn tends to be concrete, pragmatic, with its feet on the ground, always seeking to build based on its inner structure. As always, the earth runs the risk of becoming too wary of the material world, which sometimes makes the Capricornian worry so much about this area that it ends up neglecting other spheres of life. While it enjoys tranquility in material matters, it is not usually a flashy sign but rather austere, making it an excellent administrator.</p>
<p>Capricorn is demanding of itself and others, always seeking to reach a little higher, an ambition that drives it to strive to improve and try to be better at what it does. In this path of self-development, it should pay attention not to neglect its affections and emotional needs (which it often finds challenging to connect with) since it prioritizes duty over pleasure. On the other hand, the commitment to responsibilities often puts it in the role of a leader, foreman, authority, transmitting a clear message of security and generally being somewhat demanding of others.</p>
<p>Capricorn has a certain vein in which it seeks to be recognized by others (although it may not always be sure of deserving such high esteem, as in the case of Leo); it will try to be really good at something.</p>
<p>In addition to concrete and tangible interests, Capricorn usually seeks to acquire knowledge that allows it to climb a new step on the social or, at a more spiritual level, on the scale of its own personal evolution. Hence, the mysterious symbol of the goat, which climbs slowly and alone (unlike sheep that progress in flocks), and the fish tail that gives it the possibility of accessing the depths.</p>
<p>Regarding emotional relationships, it tends to be reserved about its feelings. It should avoid repressing its emotions, as in that case, the lack of emotional expression will make it seem somewhat indifferent or cold. Generally, it will seek a relationship that provides a certain amount of stability or security and will know how to provide support to those close to it.</p>
<p>Its ruling planet, Saturn, the mythological god considered the wise old man or teacher, is linked to the archetype of the father, which gives it its paternal or protective attitudes. Capricorns are likely to be accustomed to taking care of others in some way throughout life (regardless of their age). Showing their mature side will serve them well to overcome challenges until they feel that the burdens have become too heavy. Then life will have to teach them to delegate, trust others more, relax, and not want to have everything under control.</p>
