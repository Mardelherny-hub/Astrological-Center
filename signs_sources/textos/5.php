<p>Leo is a fire sign that tends to show confidence and self-assurance. I think Leo is like the Sun, radiating energy to others (enthusiasm, generosity, warmth) and at the same time centralizing attention, in a double movement from itself to the external world, and vice versa. Since Leo usually leads action, it is attentive to the responses of others to its initiatives, and it will care about feeling recognized. Like all fire signs, Leo is bold, creative, usually moves through life with optimism and spontaneity, awakening in others that "inner flame" that we all carry within. Hence, it is associated with charismatic leaders, as its natural authority, strong presence, and drama usually do not go unnoticed. This firmness can become a problem when its worst enemies (pride, vanity) take the stage. Then it will have to retrace its steps to learn to recognize that everyone makes mistakes at some point, including itself.</p>

<p>I believe that Leo, in the end, seeks to discover itself, find itself, and in this search, it will often be aware of the gaze of others, admiration or not, seeking to answer the question "Who am I?". When it succeeds, its creativity can become limitless.</p>

<p>Something interesting is that Leo will not only motivate itself but also knows how to motivate others. Although it is not a sign of strategies (just as fire does not know the cold), its spontaneity and spirit of play usually guide it. However, other times this lack of planning in the face of its great goals can lead it to underestimate details and not be very realistic in its plans.</p>

<p>Leo is a passionate sign; in its affective bonds, it tends to be loyal above all, generous, and protective. It knows how to listen to its heart and express its feelings, exhibiting its interest and skill in expressive areas such as art and oratory.</p>

<p>When it reaches the point of being so centered on itself without putting itself in the place of others, it can sin of arrogance. Excessive self-confidence can even lead to disappointments. Sometimes disappointments occur due to its high ambitions and expectations. After all, one thing is clear: Leo, like the Sun, its associated planet, likes to do things on a grand scale and does not deal with details. On the other hand, the Sun is also associated with physical vitality, which relates directly to Leo, as it is a very vital sign with a large reservoir of energy (it will depend on it in what it invests).</p>
