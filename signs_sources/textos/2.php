<p>Taurus is a sign characterized by a constant search for security, given its earth element. Earth is the element that sustains us, the most stable, allowing us to build, and at the same time, it is the element most linked to the physical, the Material. Our planet takes its name precisely because of these qualities, Planet Earth. Hence Taurus' interest in materializing plans and ideas, contributing to rooting all things. In addition, earth likes to take its time when making decisions. It will wait for the most correct or opportune moment to invest its energies, making Taurus cautious, reliable, and also hardworking and methodical. The bull is a ruminant animal. A ruminant is an animal that digests food in two stages, first consuming it and then ruminate. In Taurus, this happens at the level of ideas, projects, decisions; they chew them over and over, weigh them to be able to digest the different processes they go through. On the other hand, once they choose their goal, they usually do not easily deviate from their objectives. In relationships and affections, they will value fidelity and a partner who above all provides stability. They are a sign that is often affectionate and caring, expressing their feelings mainly physically or concretely (not necessarily the Libran "dialectical poetics"). One clear thing is that they find it difficult to make decisions and adapt to changes. Sometimes, the lack of a quick and immediate decision-making (in situations that require it) generates the feeling of having missed the train, the opportunity, and paying the price for it later. However, it will be worse if they feel pressured; it is better to respect their time. Being an earth sign and fixed, seeking above all security and stability, the economic aspect will be a recurring and valuable theme for this sign. Money will not only be a symbol of "security," but it will also allow them to access all those physical pleasures that they know how to enjoy. Life experiences will teach them not to overvalue the material world, as material well-being not only is not synonymous with happiness, but it does not always guarantee access to the desired sense of security or stability. Only in some cases, when the financial issue becomes an obsession or a complex. I refer to those who, despite having huge bank accounts, do not feel calm or secure and need more and more, without ever feeling fully satisfied.</p>
<p>Their ruling planet is Venus, linked to love, pleasure, and art, leading them towards the search for comfort, beauty, and preferably what is pleasant to the five physical sensesâ€”pleasure. Taurus will teach us to value pleasures and enjoy the little things, to seek harmony and tranquility above all else, and to be persistent with our goals. They will need to learn to be somewhat more flexible and to see changes not as a threat but as a new opportunity for growth and evolution.</p>
