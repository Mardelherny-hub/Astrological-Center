<p>Aquarius is often defined as the "rebel" of the zodiac. After Capricorn's order and commitment, after having built the foundations and structures, this sign appears, questioning much of what its predecessor constructed. Symbolically, this does not necessarily represent the breaking of structures (although we cannot deny that it often achieves this) - at least in most cases, Aquarius will have a need to renew and innovate. That's why we can say that Aquarians look to the future, and many times when this tendency is taken to the extreme, Aquarius can forget to live in the present, and that's when it will have to retrace its steps to reconnect with the Here and Now.</p>
<p>Let's clarify that despite having a "watery" name, Aquarius is an Air sign, and precisely in the area of emotions and feelings is not where it feels most comfortable. Since it is detached enough to fall into excessive sentimentality or romanticism, it also fears losing something, the most precious thing being its own Freedom, so it will avoid excessively demanding bonds. This does not mean that Aquarians are anti-social (as their predecessor's sign often is); in reality, Aquarius can thrive in the area of human relationships, friendships, connections with colleagues, groups, etc.</p>
<p>Many times I have chatted with Aquarians who told me, "what I want is to create something, invent something, do something different." This is the driving force that propels them to be in motion. As it is a very idealistic sign, it often suffers when realizing that the world is far from the Ideal. Here is an almost eternal dilemma between what is and what should be, which often makes them very critical (did you think only Virgos had the right to criticism?).</p>
<p>Its ruling planets are Saturn (the traditional ruler) and Uranus (co-ruler). Uranus is the one that breaks with the outdated, with the rigidities and rigid schemes that bind us to the past. Saturn, on the other hand, in Aquarius represents the new structures to be built after the passage of Uranus has introduced all the necessary reforms.</p>
<p>The great challenge for the Water Bearers is to materialize their desires and visions and be able to materialize them in flesh and blood since they often do not put into practice what they preach so vehemently. Aquarius comes to teach us that we all are part of a great family, the Human Family.</p>
