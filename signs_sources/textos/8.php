<p>Scorpio is a sign of intensity. Its symbol indicates that it often appears tough on the outside but is very sensitive on the inside. I think Scorpio is the zodiac sign that comes to teach us that not everything in life is harmony and balance (something that Libra likes to believe, for example), but that crises also exist.</p>
<p>Scorpio seeks to open doors that others ignore or that perhaps, out of convenience, they prefer to leave closed. Hence its instigating, almost detective-like, fame, trying to uncover the hidden, intuiting what is not said or what is not seen in a situation. Its strategic ability is also linked to its intuition and prudence.</p>
<p>Scorpio is often a sign that goes deep into what it proposes. This gives it great determination and tenacity in its goals and passions. In fact, Scorpio is one of the 4 so-called Fixed signs (along with Taurus, Leo, and Aquarius), which share the determination to have their will done and also their innate sense of personal pride.</p>
<p>Scorpio also comes to teach that crises (although painful) are necessary since they serve us to move towards new opportunities, purifying what no longer serves us, transmuting towards more creative ways of facing experiences. Like all water signs, Scorpio is emotional and sensitive, although it demonstrates much less than Cancer and Pisces (the other water signs) what happens inside. It does not want to reveal in a simple and direct way what it feels and usually keeps its emotions and intimate feelings under lock and key. Perhaps it is a way of self-preservation against possible aggressions or betrayals that we could receive from the environment. To some extent, for Scorpio, self-preservation is wise conduct since once it has been hurt, it will find it tremendously difficult to forget the offense and close the wound. As I mentioned before, it lives with intensity, both the good and the bad that life proposes to us.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Scorpio does not know middle terms, it expresses itself in two opposite ways: the sensual Scorpio, who constantly seeks the gratification of the 5 physical senses, and the other, the spiritual Scorpio, deep and transcendent. Sometimes both coexist within the same person; other times, one aspect or the other will stand out more depending on the natal chart of each individual.</p>
<p>Another archetype linked to Scorpio has to do with the search to have control or mastery of oneself, as well as of situations and people they encounter. The more one masters oneself, consciously, that is, mastery of one's baseness, instincts, and compulsions, the more one will rise and resemble the Eagle (the other symbol linked to Scorpio) that soars above all situations. It is good to clarify that Self-mastery is not Self-repression. To repress is to seek to eliminate something in a totally inorganic way, so that it reappears again and again in different forms. Self-mastery is to overcome and transmute those defects or baseness into Virtues, and thus be able to fulfill our goals without deviating from our path.</p>
<p>In emotional relationships, Scorpio will try not to expose itself too much (at least when starting a relationship) as it fears being betrayed. Once it places trust in the other, it will live its feelings deeply and passionately. Life should teach them to forgive and forgive themselves, to forget offenses, to avoid the distrust that the fear of being betrayed on an emotional or material level produces.</p>
<p>The planets linked to Scorpio are Mars and Pluto. Mars, the planet of struggles, indicates that Scorpio knows how to fight battles in the face of obstacles due to its strength. On the other hand, Pluto is the planet of Transformations, which, like the Phoenix, dies to rise from the ashes strengthened. Understanding that Death and Resurrection are always linked, and this is something that all signs can learn from the scorpion.</p>
