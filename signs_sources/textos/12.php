<p>Pisces is one of the most sensitive and receptive signs of the zodiac. In fact, its element is Water, the most receptive element of all, associated with the inner world and the emotional aspects of existence. Water has no inherent form; it adapts to its container. This quality gives Pisces its flexibility and adaptability to different people and environments. It grants Pisces the ability to empathize with other living beings, including a frequent interest in caring for animals and nature. Pisces is seldom indifferent to the pain or suffering of others; they are natural psychologists, able to lend a listening ear and offer advice to others. Basically, it is a very humanistic sign. However, Pisces can become so emotionally involved with others to the point of absorbing other people's conflicts. On the other hand, they are often quite impressionable and susceptible to various influences. It is crucial for them to surround themselves with positive environments.</p>
<p>Pisces is a dreamer, mystic, and romantic. Therefore, they may possess artistic and aesthetic sensitivity. Their weakness lies in not being particularly pragmatic. When it comes to making decisions or facing hostile situations, Pisces often prefers to evade or postpone. Sometimes, they see themselves as weaker than they really are and face the challenge of recognizing their strength to deal with life's challenges. This way, they can avoid projecting onto others the positive qualities that they believe they lack. Often, this mechanism hides a certain low self-esteem, but at the same time, they tend to idealize people around them, attributing to them qualities that others may not possess, which can lead to feelings of disappointment. In matters of the heart, Pisces has deep feelings and needs relationships that allow for intimacy and emotional support. Due to the depth of their feelings, they find it challenging to face separations and accept the end of a relationship. Pisces should rely on beliefs in higher goals or service to others to counteract their tendency to mood swings. The duality of this sign leads them to experience changing emotional states, but it also gives them a multifaceted capacity, explaining why many actors and excellent performers with diverse roles belong to Pisces.</p>
<p>Pisces represents beliefs, faith, and hopes. Therefore, their main verb is "to believe": believe in people, believe in a philosophy, ideology, religion, or their own form of spirituality. Their ruling planet, Neptune, represents spiritual feelings, compassion, and sacrifice for suffering beings. Neptune also represents the world of fantasies, such as cinema, but also the "visions" and intuitions that come from the unconscious to guide and orient our everyday ego. Sometimes, without realizing it, they can deceive themselves, cutting reality and being somewhat partial in their judgments. If this happens, it is good to regain objectivity in the face of facts and dare to live the reality that confronts us, or, if we don't like it, strive to change it.</p>
